Koopmans functionals: accurately and efficiently predicting spectral properties with a functional formulation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the past fifteen years we have developed Koopmans functionals, a computationally efficient approach for predicting spectral properties in a functional framework [1]. These orbital-density-dependent functionals impose a generalized piecewise linearity condition, ensuring that orbital energies match the corresponding electron removal/addition total energy differences (in contrast to semi-local DFT, where a mismatch between the two lies at the heart of the band gap problem and the unreliability of Kohn-Sham orbital energies more generally). This strategy proves to be very powerful, yielding molecular orbital energies and band structures with comparable accuracy to self-consistent GW approaches but at greatly reduced computational cost and complexity [2]. This talk will cover the theory of Koopmans functionals, explain recent developments and extensions [3], and demonstrate how we perform these calculations with the recently released open-source package "koopmans" [4].
